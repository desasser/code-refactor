# code-refactor

I completed this project as practice refactoring a provided set of website code. The priorities were to simplify the CSS code by combining rulesets and minimizing redundant rules, add helpful comments to the CSS and HTML files, and modify the HTML code to utilizie semantic tags and follow accessibility guidelines.

There are no steps to install this project, it is a single page website (links are placeholders).
